# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio contains numerous reports written whilst studying for the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate). 

This shows:
* I am interested in cybersecurity and that it's much bigger than a technical subject
* I can clearly explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience
* I consider technical, financial, reputation and legal risks from an organization's perspective
