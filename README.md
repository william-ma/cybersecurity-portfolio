# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio contains numerous reports written whilst studying for [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate). 

These reports show:
* I can clearly explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience
* I consider not only technical risks, but business and legal risks from an organization's perspective
