# Security incident report

## Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident

From analyzing the tcpdump logs, the main network protocol involved in the incident is DNS. 
DNS is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. 
We can see from the network logs that the client makes a DNS request to an unrecognized domain (greatrecipesforme.com) which returns an unrecognized IP address (192.0.2.17).

## Section 2: Document the incident

The cybersecurity team has confirmed the web server (yummyrecipesforme.com) was compromised by a former disgruntled employee. 
The former employee was able to gain access to the website's administrative account via a brute-force attack. This was due to the administrative account having a default password. 
Once the administrative account was compromised the password was changed, preventing the client from accessing that account. 

Using the administrative account the former employee injected malicious JavaScript code into the website causing visitors to download malware which redirected them to greatrecipesforme.com which also contains malware. 

This is proven in the investigation that was conducted by the cybersecurity team. The malware was run in a sandbox environment with tcpdump logging the network traffic. 
From the logs, it's clear that after accessing the yummyrecipesforme.com website, the client gets redirected to the malicious website (greatrecipesforme.com).  

This incident has caused multiple customers to complain to the client that their personal computers have slowed down after visiting the malicious website (greatrecipesforme.com). 

## Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks

Ideally, more than one remeditation should be implemented. 

However the simplest way to prevent brute force attacks is to use a stronger password. 
The client's administrative account was compromised due to it using a default password. The threat actor was able to guess it. 

Using a stronger password, such as having at least 14 alphanumeric characters, consisting of at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one number would increase security greatly. 

Having the password randomly generated by a password manager would improve security even more.
